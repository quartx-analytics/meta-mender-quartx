# Manifest files
This directory contains the manifest files to tell the Google repo tool where to get the
required yocto layers from.

## Supported systems
We currently support 2 systems:
```text
raspberrypi3
raspberrypi4
```

When running the repo tool you need to specify the path to the system you are building for.
